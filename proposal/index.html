            <h1>App Description</h1>
            <p>Users of this application are students who would be looking for apartments/dorms to share. <p>
            <p>This app would have a positive impact on minority groups of people by being inclusive and allowing them to express themselves with their race, sexuality, and age on their profiles so they can connect with others.</p>
            <p>Users will be able to look for apartments/dorms to share with other students who share the same preferences with them with this app. The first Interactive features we are expecting to provide with this app are filters for users to find other users who share the same preferences as them like price range, age, and sexuality.  The second interactive feature would be creating a profile, and the third interactive feature would be clicking on other user’s profiles to view more information like for example their Spotify playlists and how to contact them.</p>
            <p>The information the user will be viewing is other users Spotify playlists using spotify’s API. This will also help users find users who share the same preferences. </p>
            <p>This app will help solve our chosen problem by making it easier for users to find people who share their same preferences making it easier to match with them then connect with them.</p>
